          Attention investors: 1) Stock brokers can accept securities as margins
          from clients only by way of pledge in the depository system w.e.f
          September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and phone number with your
          stock broker / depository participant and receive OTP directly from
          depository on your e-mail and/or mobile number to create pledge. 3)
          Check your securities / MF / bonds in the consolidated account
          statement issued by NSDL/CDSL every month.

          while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI
          registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not

          is no need to issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and

          in your bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have
